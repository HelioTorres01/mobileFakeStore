## Project Description
The mobileFakeStore is a mobile application developed with Ionic and Angular, packed with Capacitor, simulating a complete e-commerce experience. Its main goal is to demonstrate the ability to consume data from a public API (Fake Store API), displaying products, their details, and relevant information intuitively and responsively on mobile devices.

This project aims to deepen knowledge in:

Hybrid development with Ionic and Angular.
Consumption of RESTful APIs.
State management and screen navigation.
Responsive UI/UX implementation.
Utilization of version control (Git) and hosting on a public repository.
